# penalized-spline-estimation
# (Description for R code for application.txt) This is the R code for application in the paper entitled Penalized spline estimation for panel count data model with time-varying coefficients. By running this code, we can get the penalized spline estimation for formula (7). The code can be easily adapted for other panel count data model. The notes for each function can be found in the R code for application.txt file.
# (Description for sample_data.csv) This is a sample dataset for the above R code, which can be directly run after reading the sample dataset. 
# The R codes for the simulations in this paper can be provided upon request by sending me an email at 15717413159@163.com

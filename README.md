# penalized-spline-estimation
# (Description for R code for application.txt)This is the R code for application in the paper entitled Penalized spline estimation for panel count data model with time-varying coefficients. By running this code, we can get the penalized spline estimation for formula (7). The code can be easily adapted for other panel count data model. The notes for each function can be found in the R code for application.txt file.
# (Description for R codes for part of the simulations.txt) This is the R code for part of the simulations presented in section 3.2 of the aforementioned paper. The codes contain the scheme to generate the simulated dataset.  By running the codes, we can get the results for penalized spline estimators and regression spline estimators in Table 3 under sample size 100.
# The R codes for other simulations can be provided upon request by sending me an email at 15717413159@163.com

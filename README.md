# penalized-spline-estimation
# This is the R code for application in the paper entitled Penalized spline estimation for panel count data model with time-varying coefficients. By running this code, we can get the penalized spline estimation for formula (7). The code can be easily adapted for other panel count data model. The note for each function can be foung in the R code for application.txt file.
